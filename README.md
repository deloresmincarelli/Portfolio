## [Nurse Scheduling Optimization](https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/BusinessAnalyticsProjects/blob/master/NurseOptimization.pdf)
MS Business Analytics, University of Cincinnati
In this paper, we explore an optimization model that is intended to reduce the amount of time it takes a nurse manager to balance nurse self-scheduling requests with hospital requirements. This case study uses a specific department at TriHealthâ€™s Good Samaritan Hospital (GSH) in Cincinnati for initial data and business rules. This department is one of several chosen to prototype self-scheduling.

We will show that linear optimization will work within the confines of existing work processes at TriHealth, and within the limitations of their scheduling software. Our case study uses data from one scheduling period and then we show 3 additional examples designed to force the model to make the best choice given their constraints and objective
