## [Nurse Scheduling Optimization](https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/BusinessAnalyticsProjects/blob/master/NurseOptimization.pdf)
MS Business Analytics, University of Cincinnati
In this paper, we explore an optimization model that could be used to reduce the amount of time it takes a nurse manager to balance nurse self-scheduling requests with hospital requirements. This case study uses a specific department at a hospital in Cincinnati for initial data and business rules. This department was one of several chosen to prototype self-scheduling.

Our case study uses data from one scheduling period and then we show 3 additional examples designed to force the model to make the best choice given the constraints and objective.

Tools:  Python vs 3.6 and the PuLP package.
