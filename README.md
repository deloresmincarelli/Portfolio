## [Crime in Louisville 2022: Analysis & Clustering](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/Portfolio/blob/main/crimeLouisville.html)
I moved to Louisville in 2022 and decided to put my datascience skills to use by exploring public data on crime in my new home town. 
- What types of crimes occur? Where? When?
- Does the Kentucky Derby cause a spike in crime?
- Can crimes be clustered by zip code?
<br> Tools: R
<br> Technique: Kmeans clustering

## [Nurse Scheduling Optimization](https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/Portfolio/blob/main/Optimization_Portfolio.pdf)
MS Business Analytics, University of Cincinnati
<br> In this paper, I explore an optimization model that could be used to reduce the amount of time it takes a nurse manager to balance nurse self-scheduling requests with hospital requirements. This case study uses a specific department at a hospital in Cincinnati for initial data and business rules. This department was one of several chosen to prototype self-scheduling.

This case study uses data from one scheduling period, followed by 3 additional examples designed to force the model to make the best choice given the constraints and objective.

Tools:  Python vs 3.6 and the PuLP package.

## [Decision Making Under Uncertainty](https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/Portfolio/blob/main/DecisionUncertainty_Portfolio.pdf)

<br> MS Business Analytics, University of Cincinnati
<br> We have all had to make decisions when the information we have is uncertain or incomplete.  Decision - analysis techniques and simulation can help quantify what-ifs, worst-case, and best-case scenarios. 
<br> Use Case:  Motivated by an active hurricane season in 2020, I explore a framework to aide in a hospital evacuation decision.  This model includes random variables, a decision tree to quantify the cost of the decision, and simulation to explore the cost distribution.  
<br> Tools:  R, Palisade suite of software for decision tree, simulation
