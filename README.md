## Predicting Jet Engine Failure
<img src="https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/Portfolio/blob/main/images/Survivalcurve.jpg" width="500" />

Is there a competitive advantage in how businesses manage their key assets?
<br> Predicting failures impacts the bottom line. Consider the following:
<br>
- Personnel Safety - catastrophic equipment failure can be deadly in certain industries.
- Inventory Management - avoid unplanned downtime by having parts when you need them, but, avoid having too much to keep costs down.
- Reducing costs - replacing equipment too early is wasteful, but, too late can lead to overtime costs to fix in off hours, and variation in planned throughput.
<br> In this analysis, I use simulated jet engine data from NASA to predict whether an engine will fail within 30 cycles.

## [Crime in Louisville: Analysis & Clustering](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/Portfolio/blob/main/crimeLouisville.html)
I moved to Louisville in 2022 and decided to put my datascience skills to use by exploring public data on crime in my new home town. 
<b> Further,  I did not find any public advanced analytics on Louisville crime.  This is a new study! </b>
<br>
<br>
Questions Answered:
- What types of crimes occur? Where? When?
- Does the Kentucky Derby cause a spike in crime?
- Which zipcodes have similar crime patterns?
<br> Tools: R
<br> Technique: Kmeans clustering

## [Nurse Scheduling Optimization](https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/Portfolio/blob/main/Optimization_Portfolio.pdf)
MS Business Analytics, University of Cincinnati
<br> <b> How do you juggle employee shift preferences with business needs, in a way that builds confidence in a fair system? </b>
In this paper, I explore an optimization model that could be used to automate this complex decision making, reducing the amount of time it takes a nurse manager to balance nurse self-scheduling requests with hospital requirements. This case study uses a specific department at a hospital in Cincinnati for initial data and business rules. This department was one of several chosen to prototype self-scheduling.

This case study uses data from one scheduling period, followed by 3 additional examples designed to force the model to make the best choice given the constraints and objective.

Tools:  Python vs 3.6 and the PuLP package.

## [Decision Making Under Uncertainty](https://github.com/deloresmincarelli/Portfolio/blob/main/DecisionUncertainty_Portfolio.pdf)

<br> MS Business Analytics, University of Cincinnati
<br> We have all had to make decisions when the information we have is uncertain or incomplete.  Decision-analysis techniques and simulation can help quantify what-ifs, worst-case, and best-case scenarios. 
<br> Use Case:  Motivated by an active hurricane season in 2020, I explore a framework to aide in a hospital evacuation decision.  This model includes random variables, a decision tree to quantify the cost of the decision, and simulation to explore the cost distribution.  
<br> Tools:  R, Palisade suite of software for decision tree, simulation
